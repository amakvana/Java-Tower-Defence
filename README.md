A tower defence game is a real-time strategy type game, the objective of this game is to try and stop enemies from reaching to the end of the path by building towers which shoot at them as they pass by. This tower defence game is a jungle based theme, with the levels set inside on grass, water with surrounding objects such as trees. 

The towers have varied abilities that allow a combination of them on field to clear enemies out quicker. When an enemy is defeated, the player earns in game money which they can use to purchase new towers to aid combat. The choice and positioning of the towers is the core strategy and failing to position the towers correctly may result in the player losing lives.

Once the player loses all their lives, a game over screen appears to which if they have a new highscore, they can enter their name into provided fields and save it, this in turn updates the local scoreboard with the new score to later viewing. 

The tower defence game has a fair amount of features implemented into it, the key features of which are:
* Device independent design (allowing the game to work over multiple platforms).
* Ability to create new games with multiple levels/maps.
* Multiple attacking enemy types. 
* Multiple towers to aid the player into more strategic battles. 
* Sound effects.
